<p>Technical Reading Assessment</p>

<ol>
<li>The steps Ryan will be covering are to build an engine using the rails plugin new generator, build a dummy application, write a feature for an account sign up, set up accounts so they are related to an owner and write features to handle user sign in, sign up and sign out.</li>
<li>A rails engine is a miniature application that will provide functionality to its host applications. Thus it will enhance the application’s environment rather than changing it drastically.</li>
<li>Rails plugin new generation     - - full   \
                                       - - dummy – path   spec/dummy</li>
<li>The first feature being built is the ability to take sign-ups for the new accounts. The first step to take to verify its working is to create a dashboard controller to show a “New Account” line. The next step is to define a route for an “Account Sign Up” link with an account controller. Then the account model will need to be created with a field called “name.’ Then a path helper and route will need to be created. This will allow the create action to occur. The last step is to render the flash success message in the layout. This will notify you that you have successfully created a new account.</li>
